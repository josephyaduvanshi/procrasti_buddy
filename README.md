## Inspiration & Idea

I started by creating a mind map of all the features I wanted to include in my app.

[![Mind Map](https://i.imgur.com/DlTw3UA.png)](https://i.imgur.com/DlTw3UA.png)

Procrastination. Everyone has been there. Feeling overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities and paralyzed by the fear of
failure as you stare at a blank page, blinking cursor, or empty calendar. However, what if I told you that you could
transform that sense of dread into one of excitement and achievement? Procrasti Buddy is the best companion for
productivity.

After realizing that the key to overcoming procrastination was not only finding the right tools, but also the right
mindset, I was inspired to create Procrasti Buddy. Because of this, I made the decision to develop an application that
not only features essential productivity tools like a Pomodoro timer, appointment scheduling, reminders for bills and
payments, and task management, but also an NLP AI bot that users can interact with to request productivity tips and
advice on a variety of topics related to their work and personal lives.
I wanted to create something truly unique rather than just another productivity app. Because of this, I decided to build
Procrasti Buddy with the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language so that it could run on both Android and
iOS
devices. I wanted to create an app that was not only useful but also visually appealing, simple to use, and customizable
to the needs of the user.

## What it does

Procrasti Buddy is an all-in-one productivity app that I created to help users increase their productivity and manage
their daily tasks more effectively. I designed the app to include essential tools such as a Pomodoro timer, appointment
scheduling, bill and payment reminders, and task management. But I didn't stop there, I also included an NLP AI bot that
users can interact with to ask for productivity tips and advice on various aspects of their work and personal life. I
wanted to create an app that not only provides the tools for productivity but also the guidance and support users need
to develop the right mindset to overcome procrastination.

## How I built it

### Folder Structure

[![Folder Structure](https://i.imgur.com/CNP9dgr.png)](https://i.imgur.com/CNP9dgr.png)

The app was built using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language. It is designed to work on both iOS and
Android platforms. The app's features include a Pomodoro timer, appointment scheduling, bill and payment reminders, and
task management, as well as an NLP AI bot that users can interact with to ask for productivity tips and advice on
various aspects of their work and personal life.I wanted to create something truly unique rather than just another
productivity app. Because of this, I decided to build Procrasti Buddy with the Flutter framework and the Dart
programming
language so that it could run on both Android and iOS devices. I wanted to create an app that was not only useful but
also visually appealing, simple to use, and customizable to the needs of the user.

## Challenges I ran into

The Somewhat of challenge I faced was integrating the NLP AI bot into the app with voice features and all. I had to
learn how to use the OPEN API and integrate it with the app. I also had to learn how to use the Hive database to store
the user's data locally so that it could be accessed even when offline.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

The finished product that I have created makes me extremely proud. Especially in just Four days of development.
ProcrastiBuddy is more than just an app; it is a productivity companion that enables users to manage their daily tasks
more effectively and increase their productivity. The best part is that there are no advertisements at all! It is made
to comprehend the user's issue and offer the most effective solution. It is a one-stop solution for all your
productivity needs.

## What I learned

During the development process of Procrasti Buddy, I learned several important things. One of the most significant
things
was the implementation of speech-to-text functionality. It was a tricky process, but I was determined to make it work. I
had to tweak some packages to work with the project, but after a lot of hard work, I was able to include this feature in
the final version of the app. This experience helped me to better understand the importance of speech-to-text
functionality, and how it can be used to improve the user experience.

Another key thing I learned is the importance of conversational AI in an app like ProcrastiBuddy. The NLP AI bot in the
app is not just any ordinary bot, it is designed to understand the user's problem and give the best possible solution.
This made me realize the power of AI in enhancing user engagement and providing personalized solutions.

In addition to these specific technical skills, I also learned the importance of having a clear vision, a well-defined
plan, and the willingness to put in the hard work to make that vision a reality. I learned that with a clear goal in
mind and a good amount of hard work and determination, I can achieve anything I set my mind to.

Overall, the development process of Procrasti Buddy was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot of
valuable skills and gained a deeper understanding of how to build an app that truly stands out in the crowded world of
productivity apps.

## What's next for Procrasti Buddy

The next step for Procrasti Buddy is to add more features to the app. I plan to add a shopping list feature, a calendar
feature, and a feature that allows users to set goals and track their progress. Procrasti Buddy is only the beginning of
my journey. I intend to keep updating and improving the app, adding new features and fixing any reported bugs. I'm
always looking for ways to improve the app to better meet the needs of its users and am open to user feedback and
suggestions. I'm glad I was able to turn my own struggle with procrastination into something beneficial and helpful for
others. You'll be able to say goodbye to procrastination and hello to productivity, a happier, more successful life, and
Procrasti Buddy by your side.

## Pomodoro Timer

[![Pomodoro Timer](https://i.imgur.com/wIGP8gS.png)](https://i.imgur.com/wIGP8gS.png)

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally
25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a Pomodoro, from the Italian word for
tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. The technique has been widely
popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as time
boxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair
programming contexts.
